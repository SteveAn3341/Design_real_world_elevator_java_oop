Elevator Features Summary
Serve the First Pressed User:

When a user presses the button, the elevator acknowledges that request and adds it to the appropriate request list (up or down).
The elevator will prioritize the request of the user who pressed the button first and move to their floor.
Prioritize Order:

The elevator handles requests based on direction first (up or down). If a user is already on board, the elevator will serve their destination request before considering additional requests.
Once the elevator has reached the floor of the user who pressed first, it then processes any additional requests that are in the same direction.
Nearby Requests Handling:

When moving up or down, the elevator looks for nearby requests (within a defined distance, e.g., 2 floors) that match the current direction.
If a user at a nearby floor also wants to go in the same direction (e.g., upward while the elevator is moving up), the elevator will stop at that floor to pick them up.
The same logic applies when the elevator is moving downâ€”it will stop at nearby lower floors with users requesting to go down.
Clarification on Order vs. Proximity
Order of Requests:

The elevator will still prioritize the order of requests from the initial user who called it. If the elevator is on its way to pick up User 1, it will first ensure that User 1 is picked up before moving to other requests.
Proximity and Efficiency:

While serving User 1, if there are nearby requests, the elevator will stop for those requests as long as it does not significantly delay the journey for User 1.
The elevator might not serve those additional requests in the strict order they were made but rather based on proximity and the efficiency of the route.
Example Scenario
User 1 is at floor 1 and requests to go up to floor 5.
User 2 is at floor 3 and also wants to go up to floor 6.
User 3 is at floor 7 and wants to go down to floor 5.
Elevator Behavior:

The elevator receives User 1's request first and moves to floor 1 to pick them up.
As it moves up, it checks for nearby requests.
When it reaches floor 3, it finds User 2, who also wants to go up. The elevator stops to pick up User 2.
Finally, it continues to User 1's destination at floor 5.
After dropping off User 1 at floor 5, it can then proceed to floor 7 to pick up User 3, who wants to go down.
Conclusion
In this enhanced elevator logic:

Serving the first pressed user remains a priority.
The elevator can efficiently pick up nearby users when moving in the same direction, allowing for a better overall user experience.
This logic combines the principles of both order and proximity to ensure fairness while optimizing travel times.
